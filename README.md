# electronic-circuit-connects-ultra-sonic-sensor-and-6-servos-with-2-arduino

In this task, I designed and programmed an electronic circuit that connects the distance sensor and 6 servo motors with the first Arduino (controller) and with the second Arduino instead of the Bluetooth model, because there is no Bluetooth model in Tinkercad, where when a person is in front of the sensor for three seconds, the LED light will turn on instead of the screen and the servo motors will move.

### The circuit design 
The circuit contains:

- 2 Arduino UNO.
- 6 servo motors.
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor HC-SR04
- Wires ( red= power , black= ground , turquoise =trig and echo , yellow and green= signal , brown and pink = conect Ard1 to Ard2).
 
and the circuit was designed using tinkercad website as below:
